This folder contains the data required to obtain the codon files for each condition

1. virvarseq folder: Has the output of the virvarseq script with the counts of each codon read
2. Scripts folder: This folder has an R project file and the scripts used to obtain the codon files from the VirVarSeq output. This can be run to obtain both the codon tables and the codon tables that have the single mutations within codons removed via the pipeline_samples.R script. 
3. filter_single_mutants_codon_tables folder: Has the codon tables for all samples with single mutations in codons removed. This is what was used for the analysis.
